            <h3>Why I chose to learn at DirectEd</h3>
            <p>I chose to learn at DirectEd because:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        I am interested in coding.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I aspire to be a game developer.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        DirectEd courses have excellent time planning and a humane schedule.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <h3>...oh right, my hobbies and interests</h3>
            <p>
                <br>I like discovering new music on Spotify.
                <br>I also like taking ocassional walks. Shame I live in a concrete jungle.
                <br>I am somewhat interested in video editing, but I lack the motivation to learn it right now.</p>
